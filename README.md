# clusters_images

In this repo, I have modelled clusters of different images using Mixture model, which is a probabilistic model for clustering. The main intention is to capture
the uncertainity that a particular image is related to which class. By heuristic clustering approaches like K means, we cannot do that.
The images are placed here: 

There are 4 category of images: images showing blue sky, green forests, red sunsets and again blue rivers and some mixed images. The goal was to
capture whether some mixed images gets clustered in one particular group or they partially belong to different groups based on the model.
